# Coffeeless validator

Coffeeless validator is a package that allows JavaScript/TypeScript based applications to apply input validations
by leveraging the Builder pattern, similar to [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi) but in a simplified way, by leveraging the builder pattern validations can be applied intuitively and consistently.

The following validations will be supported:
* Required field
* Is email valid.
* Minimum and Maximum length.
